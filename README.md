t9 implementation in C:

Remember how texting used to work on a standard keypad on a phone? Well here is the implementation of how the T9 texting system works. Every key on keypad has 3 or 4 corresponding letters. By typing the corresponding number for the corresponding word, the cellphone predicts the word you are about to write. By pressing the "#" key you can cycle through the words that correspond to the given number input sequence. Try it out!

``` make ``` 
``` ./t9 dictionary.txt ```
